<h1 align="center">Purifying Task Vectors in Knowledge-Aware Subspace for Model Merging</h1>

This is the official implementation of our paper **Purifying Task Vectors in Knowledge-Aware Subspace for Model Merging** ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14697)).

We provide the code for merging on [GLUE benchmarks](./GLUE) (including RoBERTa and DeBERTa), [NLG tasks](./NLG), and [ViT models](./ViT).
